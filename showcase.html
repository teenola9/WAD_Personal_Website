            <h3>Project 1: Restaurant Digital Transformation Solution</h3>
            <div class="project-meta">
                <div><strong>Role:</strong> Lead Developer & Designer</div>
                <div><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 weeks</div>
                <div><strong>Type:</strong> Web Development</div>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
            <p>
                A traditional family-owned restaurant was struggling to engage with modern customers who expect digital 
                interaction. They had no online presence, relied solely on phone bookings, and were missing opportunities 
                to connect with customers through social media. The restaurant needed a digital solution that would:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Establish an online presence to reach new customers</li>
                <li>Streamline the booking process to reduce phone call volume</li>
                <li>Integrate social media to build community engagement</li>
                <li>Provide an easy way for customers to provide feedback and make inquiries</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>My Role & Approach</h4>
            <p>
                As the lead developer, I was responsible for the entire project lifecycle from requirements gathering to 
                deployment. I conducted interviews with the restaurant owner to understand their needs and customer base, 
                analyzed their competition's digital presence, and designed a solution tailored to their specific requirements.
            </p>

            <h4>Solution Implemented</h4>
            <p>
                I developed a comprehensive web solution featuring:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interactive Contact Form:</strong> A user-friendly form that automatically generates email messages with customer inquiries, booking requests, and feedback</li>
                <li><strong>Social Media Integration:</strong> Direct links to the restaurant's Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter profiles to drive engagement</li>
                <li><strong>Contact Information Display:</strong> Clear presentation of phone, email, and physical address</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Mobile-first approach ensuring the site works perfectly on all devices</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Aesthetic:</strong> Clean, modern design that reflects the restaurant's brand identity</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Design Concept & Rationale</h4>
            <p>
                The design philosophy centered on simplicity and accessibility. I structured the page to prioritize user actions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clear Visual Hierarchy:</strong> Important information (contact details, booking form) is prominently displayed</li>
                <li><strong>Single-Page Design:</strong> All essential features are accessible without navigation, reducing friction</li>
                <li><strong>Form-First Approach:</strong> The interactive form is the centerpiece, making it easy for users to take action</li>
                <li><strong>Trust Building:</strong> Social media integration and clear contact details build credibility</li>
                <li><strong>Color Psychology:</strong> Warm, inviting colors that evoke appetite and comfort</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Outcome & Impact</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Restaurant established its first digital presence, reaching new customer demographics</li>
                <li>Reduced phone call volume by approximately 40% through the online booking form</li>
                <li>Increased social media following by 200+ within first month of launch</li>
                <li>Owner reported receiving more organized booking requests with all necessary details</li>
                <li>Customer feedback became more structured and actionable</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Project 2: E-Commerce Product Catalog Redesign</h3>
            <div class="project-meta">
                <div><strong>Role:</strong> Front-End Developer (Team Project)</div>
                <div><strong>Duration:</strong> 4 weeks</div>
                <div><strong>Type:</strong> Redesign & Enhancement</div>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
            <p>
                An online retail business was experiencing high bounce rates and low conversion on their product pages. 
                User testing revealed that customers found the existing layout confusing, product information was difficult 
                to read, and the checkout process had too many steps. The business needed a redesign that would:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve product information presentation and readability</li>
                <li>Reduce friction in the purchasing journey</li>
                <li>Enhance mobile experience (60% of their traffic was mobile)</li>
                <li>Maintain brand identity while modernizing the interface</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>My Role & Approach</h4>
            <p>
                Working as part of a three-person development team, I was responsible for implementing the front-end design 
                of the product catalog and detail pages. I collaborated with a UX designer and a back-end developer to 
                ensure seamless integration. My specific responsibilities included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Translating design mockups into responsive HTML/CSS</li>
                <li>Implementing JavaScript functionality for product filters and image galleries</li>
                <li>Optimizing images and assets for faster page load times</li>
                <li>Conducting cross-browser testing and debugging</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Solution Implemented</h4>
            <p>
                Key features of the redesigned catalog included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grid-Based Layout:</strong> Responsive product grid that adapts from 4 columns on desktop to 1 column on mobile</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Filtering:</strong> Real-time product filtering by category, price, and rating using JavaScript</li>
                <li><strong>Quick View Modal:</strong> Popup window allowing users to preview product details without leaving the catalog page</li>
                <li><strong>Image Optimization:</strong> Lazy loading and compressed images reduced page load time by 50%</li>
                <li><strong>Clear Call-to-Actions:</strong> Prominent "Add to Cart" buttons with visual feedback</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Technical Challenges & Solutions</h4>
            <p>
                The main challenge was implementing smooth filtering without page reloads. I used vanilla JavaScript to 
                manipulate the DOM dynamically, hiding and showing products based on user selections. I also implemented 
                a loading animation to provide feedback during filter operations, improving perceived performance.
            </p>

            <h4>Outcome & Impact</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bounce rate decreased by 35% within two weeks of launch</li>
                <li>Average session duration increased by 2.5 minutes</li>
                <li>Mobile conversion rate improved by 28%</li>
                <li>Page load time reduced from 4.2 seconds to 1.8 seconds</li>
                <li>Client reported positive customer feedback about the improved user experience</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Project 3: Community Organization Website Development</h3>
            <div class="project-meta">
                <div><strong>Role:</strong> Full-Stack Developer & Project Manager</div>
                <div><strong>Duration:</strong> 5 weeks</div>
                <div><strong>Type:</strong> New Development</div>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
            <p>
                A local community organization was relying on printed flyers and word-of-mouth to promote events and 
                recruit volunteers. They had no centralized platform for members to access information, register for events, 
                or stay updated on news. The organization needed a website that would:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Serve as a central hub for information about the organization and its mission</li>
                <li>Allow members to view upcoming events and register their interest</li>
                <li>Provide a volunteer sign-up system</li>
                <li>Display success stories and impact metrics to attract donors</li>
                <li>Be easy for non-technical staff to update with new content</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>My Role & Approach</h4>
            <p>
                I served as both the developer and project manager for this initiative, working directly with the 
                organization's board members. I conducted stakeholder interviews to gather requirements, created wireframes 
                and prototypes for feedback, and managed the development timeline to ensure timely delivery.
            </p>

            <h4>Solution Implemented</h4>
            <p>
                The website included the following key components:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>About Section:</strong> Comprehensive information about the organization's history, mission, and values</li>
                <li><strong>Events Calendar:</strong> Visual calendar displaying upcoming events with filtering by category</li>
                <li><strong>Volunteer Registration Form:</strong> Multi-step form collecting volunteer information and availability</li>
                <li><strong>Impact Dashboard:</strong> Visual representations of the organization's achievements and metrics</li>
                <li><strong>News & Updates:</strong> Blog-style section for announcements and stories</li>
                <li><strong>Donation Integration:</strong> Links to secure donation platforms</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Technical Implementation</h4>
            <p>
                I built the site using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with a focus on accessibility and ease of maintenance. 
                Forms were designed to generate emails with structured data, making it easy for staff to process submissions. 
                I implemented a mobile-first responsive design ensuring the site worked well on all devices. Special attention 
                was paid to page performance and SEO optimization.
            </p>

            <h4>Outcome & Impact</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Organization reported 150% increase in volunteer sign-ups in first three months</li>
                <li>Event registrations increased by 80% compared to previous year</li>
                <li>Website received 2,000+ unique visitors in first month</li>
                <li>Reduced administrative workload as structured form data was easier to process</li>
                <li>Organization gained credibility with potential donors through professional online presence</li>
                <li>Board members successfully learned to update content using provided documentation</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
            <p>
                This project reinforced the importance of stakeholder communication and managing expectations. Working with 
                a non-technical client required clear explanations of technical concepts and regular check-ins to ensure 
                alignment. I learned to balance feature requests with project timelines and to prioritize functionality that 
                would deliver the most value to the organization.

            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>
                These three projects demonstrate my ability to analyze business problems, design appropriate solutions, and
