    <!-- ===== PROJECT CONTAINER ===== -->
    <div class="showcase-container">

        <!-- Project 1 -->
        <div class="showcase-item fade-left">
            <h2>UI / UX Design</h2>
            <p>
                My first ever UI/UX assignment required me to build an interface that matched the client’s 
                needs precisely. Initially, it was challenging because I had no prior experience 
                in this field, understanding accessibility rules, or layout psychology.
                <br><br>
                After researching design patterns from competitors and experimenting with prototypes, I created a user friendly  
                interface that met all criteria and secured a high grade. This project strengthened my 
                attention to detail and introduced me to design systems and wireframing.

        <!-- Project 2 -->
        <div class="showcase-item fade-right">
            <h2>Group University Presentation</h2>
            <p>
                As part of a team assignment, we were tasked with analysing a university problem and presenting 
                a full solution using AI & Data. Throughout the project, I contributed heavily to the research, visual design, 
                and slide structure.
                <br><br>
                A challenge we faced was uneven workload distribution among group members. I had to step up as other team members were not able to ensure the deadlines were met. The result was a successful, well-delivered 
                presentation graded by university lecturers.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Project 3 -->
        <div class="showcase-item fade-left">
            <h2>Palazzo 22 – Digital Transformation</h2>
            <p>
                This project involved redesigning the digital identity of an Italian restaurant. 
                I implemented interactive maps, a booking system, menu structure, and customer centric 
             components to improve user experience.
                <br><br>
                The challenge was creating a visually vibrant but professional experience that remained 
                readable over a GIF background. Careful contrast, spacing, and animation timing 
                delivered a seamless feel.

    <!-- ===== DESIGN CONCEPT SECTION ===== -->
    <section class="design-concepts">
        <h1 class="concept-title">P22 Design Philosophy</h1>
        <p>
            The structure of this showcase page follows a luxury approach inspired by local restaurants' such as Cut & Craft in order to gain a competitive edge.
            It features an elevated box with soft shadows, wide spacing, and smooth hover animations.
            <br><br>
            Animations are intentionally amplified when hovered over: others rise up slightly, some change colour,
            drawing the user's attention to each piece. The centre alignment and large typography ensure 
            strong readability and create a an easy digital experience consistent with the rest of my website.
