Portfolio Website - Restaurant Digital Transformation (Prototype)

Overview

This repository contains a five-page portfolio website built to meet the assessment brief for a restaurant digital transformation prototype. The site demonstrates HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills and includes an interactive form that generates an email message (mailto) from user input.

Pages

- index.html — Home / professional summary
- contact.html — Contact details and social links
- skills.html — Certificates, diplomas, and work experience
- showcase.html — Three project descriptions and design concept explanation for the Problem-Solving page
- problem.html — Problem-Solving page implementing the restaurant case study: business context, social links, contact details, and an interactive form

How to run

Open the repository in any static file server or simply open `index.html` in a browser. To deploy to GitHub Pages, push the repository to a public GitHub repository and enable Pages in the repository settings (use the main branch or docs/ folder).

AI tools used

I used GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to help draft HTML and JS snippets and to check accessibility considerations; all outputs were adapted and reviewed by me.

Notes

- The form on `problem.html` uses a mailto link to open the user's email client with pre-filled content so no server is required.
- Replace placeholder contact details and social links with real ones before deploying.

Deployment (GitHub Pages)

1. Create a new public repository on GitHub and push this project.
2. In the repository Settings -> Pages, select the main branch and root (/) as the source and save.
3. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build. The site will be available at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

Validation checklist
